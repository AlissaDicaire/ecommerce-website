<p>Bee's wax candles are better for your health too. Studies show that candles that are made from man made waxes use harsh chemicals, that when we breath in, are not healthy. When you burn bee's wax, its 100% natural and therefore your home is not being filled with toxic fumes.</p>

<p>Bee's wax candles also burn longer. So not only are they better for your physical health, but they are longer lasting and there for you to enjoy longer. You can buy them all different shapes and sizes, as well as in honey comb textures or smooth textures. The larger ones do burn longer than the smaller candles but they do burn at the same rate.</p>
